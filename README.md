# The past
Troyolo started out as an inside joke that I took way too seriously by writing a twitter bot that would tweet bitly links to silly pug gifs in response to any tweet containing the hashtag '#troyolo', but quickly evolved into a massive twitter spam bot as the power went to my head. At one point, I had it tweeting pug gifs in response to all sorts of things, spamming all sorts of people. Highlight of the trip: my spam bot encountered another spam bot and the two bots tweeted back and forth in response to each other for hours. Eventually, the monster I had created was shut down when twitter banned the account used by my spam bot. It was fun while it lasted.

# The present
Now, I've decided to reform my evil ways and transform Troyolo into a tool for good. My plan for the new Troyolo is to use it as an auto-follower bot. It'll detect when new people follow a twitter account and follow them back. Maybe that sounds useless to you, but trust me, it's a great idea.

# The future
* Schedule tweets in advance
* Support for twitter multiple accounts
* Maybe even a web-based UI, who knows!
