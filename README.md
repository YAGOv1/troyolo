# Status update

I use the `master` branch for development, so check out `stable` if you wanna see a working version. I'm currently in the middle of tidying things up and such, so content on `master` is not guaranteed to even run at the moment. 

# Automated delivery of "the drop"

1. Tweet something with the hashtag #troyolo
